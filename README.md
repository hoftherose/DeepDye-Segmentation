# Deep Dye Segmentation Code
## The Jupyter notebook doubles as a tutorial. To donwload the dataset, just uncomment the first two lines.

To use the libraries you need to download the following packages:
* Fastai
* Pytorch
* Numpy

Preferably use gpu to train the model since it is much faster. To check if you are using GPU or not, make a new cell and enter "torch.cuda.is_available()" which should return True.
